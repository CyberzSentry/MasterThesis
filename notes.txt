Security anomaly detection based on Windows Event Trace
Wykrywanie anomalii bezpiecze≈Ñstwa w oparciu o Windows Event Trace

Plan pracy:
1. Literature review
2. Implementation of algorithms
3. Application of algorithms and their comparison
4. Writing the thesis

Opis:
Host based anomaly detection with use of machine learning is a previously researched topic.
This approach will be based on the data obtained from the Event Trace for Windows framework.
Additionally research will go into testing how the algorithms behave when trained on data from multiple hosts.
